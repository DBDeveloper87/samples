0:00:23.750 --> 0:00:29.110
Patrick:
Okay, we'll be discussing the writing of-

2
0:00:29.110 --> 0:00:40.860
on how to write DeafBlind, we'll be discussing
the definitions of Deaf, Blind, and DeafBlind.

3
0:00:40.860 --> 0:00:54.370
And we'll be discussing the demographics of
the census of DeafBlind, for what the population

4
0:00:54.370 --> 0:00:56.420
is of DeafBlind within the United States.

5
0:00:56.420 --> 0:01:03.510
We'll also be discussing the causes and types
of DeafBlindness.

6
0:01:03.510 --> 0:01:12.970
Also communication methods as well as early
intervention, education, recreation, technology,

7
0:01:12.970 --> 0:01:14.960
and services.

8
0:01:14.960 --> 0:01:16.950
Kathy:
Support!

9
0:01:16.950 --> 0:01:22.930
Patrick:
Oh, and orientation to mobility.

10
0:01:22.930 --> 0:01:27.910
Okay, writing the DeafBlind word.

11
0:01:27.910 --> 0:01:36.350
In the DeafBlind community it is preferred
to being the first one: D-e-a-f-B-l-i-n-d,

12
0:01:36.350 --> 0:01:40.020
as it is considered one word.

13
0:01:40.020 --> 0:01:50.590
But for me, I prefer it to type it as "Deaf-Blind"
because it is more grammatically correct as

14
0:01:50.590 --> 0:01:52.259
with a hyphen.

15
0:01:52.259 --> 0:02:02.780
It is the conjunction of two words that will
conjoin the two words to make it one.

16
0:02:02.780 --> 0:02:05.659
D-e-a-f-B-l-i-n-d will be two separate disabilities.

17
0:02:05.659 --> 0:02:10.509
As you will see, you can also find it as Blind-Deaf.

18
0:02:10.509 --> 0:02:19.000
This would be in the case of somebody who
is born blind first and then deaf.

19
0:02:19.000 --> 0:02:26.090
I would be "Blind-Deaf" but I don't find it
in the flow of words in the English language.

20
0:02:26.090 --> 0:02:28.870
So I still use DeafBlind.

21
0:02:28.870 --> 0:02:32.140
But the most challenged is "Deaf/Blind"...

22
0:02:32.140 --> 0:02:44.360
This one is considered as "Deaf and Blind"
or "Deaf or Blind" So it would be considered

23
0:02:44.360 --> 0:02:46.319
two disabilities.

34
0:02:46.319 --> 0:02:48.120
Deafness.

25
0:02:48.120 --> 0:03:00.160
As you as you will find in a dictionary, it
is the general definition: hard of hearing

26
0:03:00.160 --> 0:03:09.319
or completely or partially unable to hear
in one or both ears.

27
0:03:09.319 --> 0:03:15.459
Medically speaking, it's the definition that
scientists and medical

28
0:03:15.459 --> 0:03:17.190
personnel will use.

29
0:03:17.190 --> 0:03:22.650
The definition in medically speaking is the
condition in

30
0:03:22.650 --> 0:03:31.239
which you have the lack of sensitivity of
sound.

31
0:03:31.239 --> 0:03:38.159
When you see the
word spelled as "deaf" lowercase D it is the

32
0:03:38.159 --> 0:03:45.129
audiological
experience of the inability to sense sound.

33
0:03:45.129 --> 0:03:49.830
And finally legally speaking: legally speaking
it's when it is

34
0:03:49.830 --> 0:03:52.530
relating to the law.

35
0:03:52.530 --> 0:03:59.019
This term is what we use when you would find
in the

36
0:03:59.019 --> 0:04:06.430
registry of the state for the United States
Census when legally speaking it

37
0:04:06.430 --> 0:04:08.980
is the degree of hearing loss.

38
0:04:08.980 --> 0:04:12.040
[Tara murmurs, inaudible]

39
0:04:12.040 --> 0:04:15.100
Patrick:
Hold on!

40
0:04:15.100 --> 0:04:18.160
Tara:
My bad!

41
0:04:18.160 --> 0:04:19.180
[Laughter]

42
0:04:19.180 --> 0:04:23.940
Patrick:
I'll explain what that means in one minute.

43
0:04:23.940 --> 0:04:25.790
Okay, degree of hearing loss.

44
0:04:25.790 --> 0:04:28.530
A person with perfect hearing will be less
than ten decibels.

45
0:04:28.530 --> 0:04:34.700
A person with mild deafness will hear between
-

46
0:04:34.700 --> 0:04:40.040
Tara, softly:
Greater than.

47
0:04:40.040 --> 0:04:44.050
Patrick:
Greater than?

48
0:04:44.050 --> 0:04:45.389
Oops.

49
0:04:45.389 --> 0:04:46.389
I meant to ask you that.

50
0:04:46.389 --> 0:04:47.760
I can't remember which direction it is.

51
0:04:47.760 --> 0:04:54.990
If you see it that way, I'm writing it was
less than, and when it's the other way, I

52
0:04:54.990 --> 0:04:56.240
write it as greater than.

53
0:04:56.240 --> 0:04:57.240
Tara:
Oh, okay.

54
0:04:57.240 --> 0:04:58.910
Less than looks like what?

55
0:04:58.910 --> 0:05:00.850
Audience:
An L!

56
0:05:00.850 --> 0:05:04.729
Tara:
It looks like an L.

57
0:05:04.729 --> 0:05:06.020
Patrick:
Okay.

58
0:05:06.020 --> 0:05:10.550
[Laughter]
So it looks like an L?

59
0:05:10.550 --> 0:05:14.410
You mean it points to the other direction.

60
0:05:14.410 --> 0:05:15.850
I've always known it as alligator points to
it.

61
0:05:15.850 --> 0:05:16.850
Tara:
Oh yeah that's confusing.

62
0:05:16.850 --> 0:05:23.639
Patrick:
So Mild deafness would be from 10 decibels

63
0:05:23.639 --> 0:05:28.450
to 30 decibels of sound.

64
0:05:28.450 --> 0:05:35.690
While Moderate will be 30 to 60 decibels of
sound.

65
0:05:35.690 --> 0:05:41.199
You also have Severe which is 60 to 90 decibels
of sound.

66
0:05:41.199 --> 0:05:49.180
And you have Profound, which is 90 to over
120 decibels of sound.

67
0:05:49.180 --> 0:05:55.740
Moderate and Severe are considered hard of
hearing, while Profound is almost totally

68
0:05:55.740 --> 0:05:56.740
deaf.

69
0:05:56.740 --> 0:05:58.000
Tara:
What I think that means is that it's less

70
0:05:58.000 --> 0:05:59.870
than -

71
0:05:59.870 --> 0:06:05.449
Patrick:
In my right ear, I am Moderate to Severe,

72
0:06:05.449 --> 0:06:08.880
and my left ear Severe to Profound.

73
0:06:08.880 --> 0:06:14.070
The degree of hearing loss is determined by
an audiogram.

74
0:06:14.070 --> 0:06:15.110
Uhh, I need the mouse here.

75
0:06:15.110 --> 0:06:18.380
Tara:
Want me to do it?

76
0:06:18.380 --> 0:06:26.180
Patrick:
I'll give you a demonstration of what the

77
0:06:26.180 --> 0:06:29.350
sound of what
hearing loss would be.

78
0:06:29.350 --> 0:06:31.960
Can you click yes please?

79
0:06:31.960 --> 0:06:34.770
Can you click the first one?

90
0:06:34.770 --> 0:06:35.770
Click here first.

81
0:06:35.770 --> 0:06:36.770
Tara:
He can't see the mouse.

82
0:06:36.770 --> 0:06:39.949
He only knows there's a screen up there.

83
0:06:39.949 --> 0:06:42.480
He's not really reading anything off of the
screen.

84
0:06:42.480 --> 0:06:46.130
Automated Male Voice:
By listening to the hearing loss samples from

85
0:06:46.130 --> 0:06:49.009
this
presentation you will hear what it's like

86
0:06:49.009 --> 0:06:51.600
to have a variety of different
hearing losses.

87
0:06:51.600 --> 0:06:55.550
Before starting it's probably a good idea
to adjust the

88
0:06:55.550 --> 0:07:00.460
intensity of my voice to a comfortable listening
level.

89
0:07:00.460 --> 0:07:06.680
This program is best heard using a computer
with a good external speaker system or quality

90
0:07:06.680 --> 0:07:08.169
ear phones.

91
0:07:08.169 --> 0:07:13.710
To hear the samples simply click your mouse
on the corresponding buttons.

92
0:07:13.710 --> 0:07:14.800
Tara:
Normal hearing, right, this normal.

93
0:07:14.800 --> 0:07:18.360
Automated Voice:
this is a representation of normal conversational

94
0:07:18.360 --> 0:07:19.360
speech.

95
0:07:19.360 --> 0:07:24.449
Assuming that you have normal hearing and
a good sound system with your computer you

96
0:07:24.449 --> 0:07:27.620
should
have no trouble hearing a broad spectrum of

97
0:07:27.620 --> 0:07:28.669
speech sounds.

98
0:07:28.669 --> 0:07:31.319
Tara:
This is normal, right?

99
0:07:31.319 --> 0:07:35.169
Tara:
This is mild.

100
0:07:35.169 --> 0:07:39.660
If you had a mild hearing loss, this is what
you would hear.

101
0:07:39.660 --> 0:07:42.669
[Automated Voice continues in the background,
and is indistinguishable]

102
0:07:42.669 --> 0:07:44.550
Tara:
It's harder to hear, correct?

103
0:07:44.550 --> 0:07:47.510
Now this is mild high frequency loss.

104
0:07:47.510 --> 0:07:50.539
Automated Voice:
This is an example of high frequency hearing

105
0:07:50.539 --> 0:07:51.539
loss often sound in people who have been exposed
to noise.

106
0:07:51.539 --> 0:08:04.110
The quality of my speech is slightly muffled
especially for high frequency sounds like

107
0:08:04.110 --> 0:08:06.830
TTHH and SHHHH.

108
0:08:06.830 --> 0:08:11.020
Tara:
Do you see it's like that, that's damage hearing

109
0:08:11.020 --> 0:08:13.800
loss from like using
machines or -

110
0:08:13.800 --> 0:08:17.280
Kathy:
Sitting in cars with loud ka-booms, iPods,

111
0:08:17.280 --> 0:08:21.720
earphones in your ears all the time, going
to concerts...

112
0:08:21.720 --> 0:08:26.940
[Automated Voice continues in the background,
and is indistinguishable]

113
0:08:26.940 --> 0:08:30.419
Tara:
This is high frequency loss.

114
0:08:30.419 --> 0:08:35.640
[Automated Voice continues in the background,
and is indistinguishable]

115
0:08:35.640 --> 0:08:38.610
Tara:
It's hard to understand high frequency sounds.

116
0:08:38.610 --> 0:08:43.630
This is when someone talks and there, there's
all this background noise.

117
0:08:43.630 --> 0:08:49.210
And this is what hearing aids normally do
for people and like Patrick when he when he's

118
0:08:49.210 --> 0:08:51.100
trying to hear somebody and there's background
noise he

119
0:08:51.100 --> 0:08:52.100
almost can't hear anything.

120
0:08:52.100 --> 0:08:53.100
Listen, this is what it sounds like.

121
0:08:53.100 --> 0:08:54.100
Automated Male Voice:
In the sample you will hear my voice in the

122
0:08:54.100 --> 0:08:55.100
presence of background noise.

123
0:08:55.100 --> 0:08:56.100
[Automated Voice plays in the background,
with loud various background noise making

124
0:08:56.100 --> 0:08:57.100
speech indistinguishable]

125
0:08:57.100 --> 0:08:58.100
Tara:
See how hard he is to understand?

126
0:08:58.100 --> 0:08:59.100
[Automated Voice continues in the background,
and is indistinguishable]

127
0:08:59.100 --> 0:09:00.100
Tara:
That's when he usually shuts the hearing aids

128
0:09:00.100 --> 0:09:04.120
off because he can't hear anyway.

129
0:09:04.120 --> 0:09:16.060
Kathy:
Just because the hearing aid picks up the

130
0:09:16.060 --> 0:09:27.529
sound going in the ear, it doesn't distinguish
where it's coming from.

131
0:09:27.529 --> 0:09:34.530
[Automated Voice plays a new clip with the
speech distorted and indistinguishable]

132
0:09:34.530 --> 0:09:37.690
Tara:
And Distorted Speech Hearing Loss.

133
0:09:37.690 --> 0:09:39.000
Okay.

134
0:09:39.000 --> 0:09:41.630
Patrick:
Okay...

135
0:09:41.630 --> 0:09:42.950
Blindness.

136
0:09:42.950 --> 0:09:57.850
Generally speaking, it's being unable to see
for the lack of perception

137
0:09:57.850 --> 0:10:06.700
of light will form due to psychological or
physiological factors.

138
0:10:06.700 --> 0:10:14.310
Medically speaking you would have, when terms
are medically speaking, someone with total

139
0:10:14.310 --> 0:10:21.620
blindness would have the inability to see
either light or form and it is called on the

140
0:10:21.620 --> 0:10:30.520
paperwork NLP which mean s No Light Perception.

141
0:10:30.520 --> 0:10:34.320
What's the top?

142
0:10:34.320 --> 0:10:40.650
Blindness would be – Legal Blindness?

143
0:10:40.650 --> 0:10:49.760
In the United States and Europe when you are
classified

144
0:10:49.760 --> 0:10:52.790
as legal blindness you have 20...

145
0:10:52.790 --> 0:10:54.660
20/200 vision or less.

146
0:10:54.660 --> 0:10:57.899
Well vision is between 20/70 and 20/200.

147
0:10:57.899 --> 0:11:05.300
And 10% of those classified as legal blind,
legally blind are totally blind.

148
0:11:05.300 --> 0:11:13.920
And umm 80% of those with legal blindness
have some vision.

149
0:11:13.920 --> 0:11:21.579
By the World Health Organization's International
statistical classification, of the tenth revision,

150
0:11:21.579 --> 0:11:25.870
what's the top one again?

151
0:11:25.870 --> 0:11:35.410
Well vision is between, is less than 3/18,
but more than or equal to 3/60.

152
0:11:35.410 --> 0:11:41.630
Total blindness - I mean, any visual field
is less than 20

153
0:11:41.630 --> 0:11:50.480
degrees of how much that you can see in the
visual field.

154
0:11:50.480 --> 0:11:55.790
Uhh, blindness will be - Let me start over.

155
0:11:55.790 --> 0:11:59.680
Tara:
Oh here it goes.

156
0:11:59.680 --> 0:12:02.800
"A normal-" no, nope.

157
0:12:02.800 --> 0:12:08.240
No, it's not – it's, I don't know.

158
0:12:08.240 --> 0:12:13.690
Patrick:
It's not supposed to go automatically.

159
0:12:13.690 --> 0:12:20.700
Tara:
I don't know, how do you stop it?

160
0:12:20.700 --> 0:12:26.959
Patrick:
I don't know, I have it on set on animation.

161
0:12:26.959 --> 0:12:29.500
Kathy, ruefully:
Technology.

162
0:12:29.500 --> 0:12:32.030
Patrick:
Ummm, Kathy?

163
0:12:32.030 --> 0:12:33.730
Tara:
Kathy?

164
0:12:33.730 --> 0:12:34.730
[laughter]

165
0:12:34.730 --> 0:12:37.110
Kathy:
Hit escape!

166
0:12:37.110 --> 0:12:38.800
Tara:
Okay!

167
0:12:38.800 --> 0:12:48.350
Patrick:
Say an individual, you are classified as DeafBlind.

168
0:12:48.350 --> 0:12:55.029
If you are classified as DeafBlind medically,
you would be able to receive special education

169
0:12:55.029 --> 0:12:58.740
services from the schools.

170
0:12:58.740 --> 0:13:05.269
Types of DeafBlindness.

171
0:13:05.269 --> 0:13:14.649
These are disorders that have DeafBlind exclusively.

172
0:13:14.649 --> 0:13:22.850
Usher Syndrome, which is Retinitis Pigmentosa
of the blindness with a form of hearing loss.

173
0:13:22.850 --> 0:13:30.800
Usher Syndrome has 3 types and is a genetic
disorder.

174
0:13:30.800 --> 0:13:39.850
When you have Type 1, you are born Deaf and
have tunnel vision at, at childhood.

175
0:13:39.850 --> 0:13:48.860
Type 2, you are born hard of hearing and will
receive your Retinitis Pigmentosa or "RP"

176
0:13:48.860 --> 0:13:50.550
in your teenage years.

177
0:13:50.550 --> 0:13:55.610
RP is tunnel vision and night blindness.

178
0:13:55.610 --> 0:14:06.130
And number - Type 3 will be the uh, you would
receive – you were born with good hearing

179
0:14:06.130 --> 0:14:10.690
but will later progress with hard of hearing
later in life.

180
0:14:10.690 --> 0:14:17.700
And in most cases, RP does not show until
around early adulthood.

181
0:14:17.700 --> 0:14:30.279
Type 1 and 2 is approximately 2.4% of the
entire Deaf population within the United States.

182
0:14:30.279 --> 0:14:41.970
Demographics for the Census of the population
of DeafBlindness.

183
0:14:41.970 --> 0:14:51.800
Within the state of North Carolina approximately
700 people have been classified as DeafBlind

184
0:14:51.800 --> 0:14:55.670
within the National Registry of DeafBlindness.

185
0:14:55.670 --> 0:15:00.930
This national registry is not the statistical
information, rather

186
0:15:00.930 --> 0:15:02.690
it is voluntary.

187
0:15:02.690 --> 0:15:10.760
But according to the Division of Services
for the Blind there is approximately 900.

188
0:15:10.760 --> 0:15:17.470
Within the United States alone there is approximately...
umm

189
0:15:17.470 --> 0:15:27.089
according to the Children's Census by the
National Technical Assistance Consortium for

190
0:15:27.089 --> 0:15:35.910
those who are DeafBlind Youths and Children
there's up to 2005 Census is 10,000.

191
0:15:35.910 --> 0:15:49.810
Adding to that, from ages birth to 21 and
going on to age 80, that would equal about

192
0:15:49.810 --> 0:15:50.910
40,000 people.

193
0:15:50.910 --> 0:15:59.670
With the demographics of the Deaf population
at 2.4% that would equal around 30,000 with

194
0:15:59.670 --> 0:16:05.220
Usher Syndrome which will bring to the census
of 70,000.

195
0:16:05.220 --> 0:16:14.170
We do not know the exact population of the
Deaf, of those who are DeafBlind worldwide

196
0:16:14.170 --> 0:16:20.290
as in the national registry but there may
be some sources internationally.

197
0:16:20.290 --> 0:16:24.510
In September there's an international conference
on DeafBlindness.

198
0:16:24.510 --> 0:16:28.700
What causes DeafBlindness?

199
0:16:28.700 --> 0:16:38.470
It can be genetic, congenital, or acquired.

200
0:16:38.470 --> 0:16:41.130
Genetic is something like Usher Syndrome.

201
0:16:41.130 --> 0:16:48.279
Congenital would be similar to something like
Congenital Rubella Syndrome.

202
0:16:48.279 --> 0:16:57.110
In 1964 there was the Rubella Epidemic in
which many people within the United States

203
0:16:57.110 --> 0:17:08.870
and worldwide received Rubella through birth
and were affected while still living.

204
0:17:08.870 --> 0:17:18.159
You - If the mother is infected with Rubella
or the German Measles, the child, while she

205
0:17:18.159 --> 0:17:23.540
is pregnant, can receive Congenital Rubella
Syndrome.

206
0:17:23.540 --> 0:17:32.650
And in some cases, C.R.S. which is the abbreviation
for Congenital Rubella Syndrome, they are

207
0:17:32.650 --> 0:17:33.980
DeafBlind.

208
0:17:33.980 --> 0:17:35.309
Yes?

209
0:17:35.309 --> 0:17:37.970
… Pardon me?

210
0:17:37.970 --> 0:17:39.299
No.

211
0:17:39.299 --> 0:17:49.950
[Patrick and Tara speak softly, speech is
indistinguishable]

212
0:17:49.950 --> 0:17:59.270
Patrick:
Measles... no, she had ill fever.

213
0:17:59.270 --> 0:18:01.940
Umm, Acquired.

214
0:18:01.940 --> 0:18:07.750
If you had similar to what Helen Keller had,
was a high fever.

215
0:18:07.750 --> 0:18:14.980
So she became Deaf and Blind while in sickness.

216
0:18:14.980 --> 0:18:28.020
So when she recovered she had no vision or
hearing.

217
0:18:28.020 --> 0:18:35.850
And, I got them all there.

218
0:18:35.850 --> 0:18:38.460
Okay, okay.

219
0:18:38.460 --> 0:18:48.700
The Americans With Disabilities Act was enacted
in 1990 but not officially done until 1991.

220
0:18:48.700 --> 0:18:56.020
This act provides accessibility and the protection
of DeafBlind-I mean, not DeafBlind but all

221
0:18:56.020 --> 0:18:57.020
persons of disabilities.

222
0:18:57.020 --> 0:19:05.120
The Individuals with Disabilities Educational
Act or the I.D.E.A. was first established

223
0:19:05.120 --> 0:19:10.760
in 2001 by Congress, and was revised in 2004.

224
0:19:10.760 --> 0:19:19.490
This law provides the provision of an I.E.P.
for Individualized Educational Plan for persons

225
0:19:19.490 --> 0:19:21.190
with disabilities.

226
0:19:21.190 --> 0:19:28.460
Section 504 is the Civil Rights Law for those
with disabilities.

227
0:19:28.460 --> 0:19:38.419
In Section 508 it's the law that provides,
that calls for the provision of accessible

228
0:19:38.419 --> 0:19:41.890
access on the internet for persons with disabilities

229
0:19:41.890 --> 0:19:45.080
Communications?

230
0:19:45.080 --> 0:19:48.270
Okay.

231
0:19:48.270 --> 0:20:07.990
American Sign Language, Communication Cards,
writing back and forth, print on palm, emergency

232
0:20:07.990 --> 0:20:10.860
electronic, and Braille..

233
0:20:10.860 --> 0:20:19.940
American Sign Language is the official sign
language of American Culture for sign language.

234
0:20:19.940 --> 0:20:23.340
Each country has their own sign language.

235
0:20:23.340 --> 0:20:27.960
In the United States, there are actually three
structures.

236
0:20:27.960 --> 0:20:33.450
American Sign Language, which is their own
language.

237
0:20:33.450 --> 0:20:43.140
Pidgin Sign English would use American Signs
but will be in the English structure of grammar.

238
0:20:43.140 --> 0:20:52.159
And Signed Exact English is every single word
in the English Language, for word for word.

239
0:20:52.159 --> 0:20:58.320
For example, in ASL the word "the" does not
exist, nor does the word "and."

240
0:20:58.320 --> 0:21:03.270
Tara:
The word "THE"… umm, what do you do?

241
0:21:03.270 --> 0:21:05.340
Do you do ASL?

242
0:21:05.340 --> 0:21:06.370
Patrick:
ASL?

243
0:21:06.370 --> 0:21:11.909
I'm not ASL yet, but I'll be studying ASL
2 at Central

244
0:21:11.909 --> 0:21:16.240
Piedmont Community College in the fall.

245
0:21:16.240 --> 0:21:22.520
Tara:
What do you do?

246
0:21:22.520 --> 0:21:24.470
Patrick:
I use Pidgin Signs.

247
0:21:24.470 --> 0:21:25.470
Tara:
What's that?

248
0:21:25.470 --> 0:21:27.840
Patrick:
ASL Signs but its, I mean, ASL has its own

249
0:21:27.840 --> 0:21:31.460
grammar just like English has its own grammar.

250
0:21:31.460 --> 0:21:38.560
So we would use in Pidgin Sign, ASL signs
but in English sentence.

251
0:21:38.560 --> 0:21:49.460
So, if I was to do the Pledge of Allegiance
in ASL, I wouldn't use the word "the," "of,"

252
0:21:49.460 --> 0:21:51.020
and such.

253
0:21:51.020 --> 0:21:54.550
I think I'll do a demonstration.

254
0:21:54.550 --> 0:21:59.770
"I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United
States of America.

255
0:21:59.770 --> 0:22:08.780
To the Republic for which is stands, one nation
under God, indivisible with Liberty, Justice

256
0:22:08.780 --> 0:22:09.900
for all."

257
0:22:09.900 --> 0:22:12.380
That was ASL.

258
0:22:12.380 --> 0:22:18.240
But if was to do it in Pidgin Sign or Signed
Exact English, it would be:

259
0:22:18.240 --> 0:22:28.430
"I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United
States of America.

260
0:22:28.430 --> 0:22:41.289
And to the Republic for which is stands, one
nation under God, with Liberty and Justice

261
0:22:41.289 --> 0:22:47.140
(or Justice) for all (or all)."

262
0:22:47.140 --> 0:22:49.450
Communication Cards.

263
0:22:49.450 --> 0:22:53.410
Tara:
This is how he communicates by the way.

264
0:22:53.410 --> 0:22:56.909
Patrick:
Some DeafBlind cannot speak for themselves

265
0:22:56.909 --> 0:23:04.559
because they do not have enough voice skills
or speaking skills, so they would have cards

266
0:23:04.559 --> 0:23:09.299
that will tell the other hearing person what
they are trying to say.

267
0:23:09.299 --> 0:23:14.480
It's not in there, I just need to reach across
the card.

268
0:23:14.480 --> 0:23:15.480
Tara:
Okay.

269
0:23:15.480 --> 0:23:19.580
Patrick:
The umm... but I would have a card and someone

270
0:23:19.580 --> 0:23:21.909
would tell me what it says.

271
0:23:21.909 --> 0:23:28.549
Like, I have umm for the Charlotte Transit
setting system I have a

272
0:23:28.549 --> 0:23:32.799
card that would tell me what bus I'm on.

273
0:23:32.799 --> 0:23:39.640
One method would be for someone to write on
a laminated sheet of paper with dry erase,

274
0:23:39.640 --> 0:23:41.330
a notepad, or a whiteboard.

275
0:23:41.330 --> 0:23:48.380
Mrs. Costenoble is going to write something
to see what I would see what I can say.

276
0:23:48.380 --> 0:23:50.000
Okay....

277
0:23:50.000 --> 0:23:53.250
"Good job!"

278
0:23:53.250 --> 0:23:54.880
[laughter]

279
0:23:54.880 --> 0:24:04.630
Or some people – where is it?

280
0:24:04.630 --> 0:24:12.390
Or some people with electronic communication
would be able to use communication.

281
0:24:12.390 --> 0:24:15.110
Tara:
Is it on?

281
0:24:15.110 --> 0:24:17.559
Patrick:
This PacMate is a keyboard which has a Braille

282
0:24:17.559 --> 0:24:19.539
display on the bottom.

283
0:24:19.539 --> 0:24:22.690
So Mrs. Costenoble might write something.

284
0:24:22.690 --> 0:24:24.970
Tara:
Oops.

285
0:24:24.970 --> 0:24:32.970
But you can't tell what you're writing.

286
0:24:32.970 --> 0:24:36.400
Seeing people can.

287
0:24:36.400 --> 0:24:38.690
Patrick:
Okay.

288
0:24:38.690 --> 0:24:43.309
So Mrs. Costenoble has written "How I-"

289
0:24:43.309 --> 0:24:44.980
Tara:
Oops!

290
0:24:44.980 --> 0:24:45.980
I messed up!

291
0:24:45.980 --> 0:24:46.980
Patrick:
Excuse me.

292
0:24:46.980 --> 0:24:48.030
"How I sth-"

293
0:24:48.030 --> 0:24:49.030
Tara:
Erase!

294
0:24:49.030 --> 0:24:50.030
Erase!

295
0:24:50.030 --> 0:24:51.920
I'll fix it, I'll write it.

296
0:24:51.920 --> 0:24:55.040
Okay, erase it!

297
0:24:55.040 --> 0:24:57.120
Erase, erase!

298
0:24:57.120 --> 0:24:58.160
[Laughter]

299
0:24:58.160 --> 0:25:01.280
Patrick, laughing:
Okay.

300
0:25:01.280 --> 0:25:04.390
Tara:
Okay now.

301
0:25:04.390 --> 0:25:13.390
Patrick:
The problem with the PacMate is that you can't

302
0:25:13.390 --> 0:25:16.150
see what you're writing.

303
0:25:16.150 --> 0:25:17.640
But there are other technologies.

304
0:25:17.640 --> 0:25:19.500
Such as the DeafBlind Communicator.

305
0:25:19.500 --> 0:25:21.360
Let's see what she's got.

306
0:25:21.360 --> 0:25:23.230
"How is the weather?"

307
0:25:23.230 --> 0:25:26.630
Hmmm, I don't know!

308
0:25:26.630 --> 0:25:27.770
[laughter]

309
0:25:27.770 --> 0:25:35.779
The DeafBlind Communicator was invented in
Denmark.

310
0:25:35.779 --> 0:25:40.830
You would have – it's an un-foldable case
of leather.

311
0:25:40.830 --> 0:25:50.289
Like she would have the keyboard to her, and
I would have the braille display on my side

312
0:25:50.289 --> 0:25:55.850
and it would be visual side for that person
to see.

313
0:25:55.850 --> 0:26:00.890
It would work for the musicians!

314
0:26:00.890 --> 0:26:04.470
Ummm, Recreation and Sports.

315
0:26:04.470 --> 0:26:12.159
The Deaf and Blind community have their own
coachable teams.

316
0:26:12.159 --> 0:26:18.830
The Southeast Association of the Deaf has
their own basketball tournament.

317
0:26:18.830 --> 0:26:28.480
And in October I went to the North Carolina
School for the Deaf Homecoming which uhh football

318
0:26:28.480 --> 0:26:34.630
which competed against Ohio School for the
Deaf.

319
0:26:34.630 --> 0:26:37.890
And NCSD won!

320
0:26:37.890 --> 0:26:42.520
They also have their own camps as well.

321
0:26:42.520 --> 0:26:47.490
The Blind community has their own sports.

322
0:26:47.490 --> 0:26:56.820
It is actually another version of the sport
that visual people would play.

323
0:26:56.820 --> 0:27:08.970
GoalBall is the blind version of soccer while
Beep Baseball is the Blind's version of baseball.

324
0:27:08.970 --> 0:27:17.340
They're actually different from the other
two because GoalBall [cough] I haven't talked

325
0:27:17.340 --> 0:27:19.650
this much in -

326
0:27:19.650 --> 0:27:20.650
[Laughter]

327
0:27:20.650 --> 0:27:26.570
Tara:
He's like, "I haven't talked this much..."

328
0:27:26.570 --> 0:27:28.870
You have to...

329
0:27:28.870 --> 0:27:30.410
Patrick:
Okay.

330
0:27:30.410 --> 0:27:38.419
GoalBall – eh, I'll wait 'til I get to pictures
to explain it.

331
0:27:38.419 --> 0:27:46.669
And what was the last one?

332
0:27:46.669 --> 0:27:49.419
Tara:
Beep.

333
0:27:49.419 --> 0:27:53.549
Patrick:
Oh, okay.

334
0:27:53.549 --> 0:27:54.929
Judo.

335
0:27:54.929 --> 0:27:58.040
Hey, the picture didn't come up.

336
0:27:58.040 --> 0:27:59.680
Tara:
I don't know.

337
0:27:59.680 --> 0:28:00.680
Oh well.

338
0:28:00.680 --> 0:28:02.740
No, I saw the pictures already.

339
0:28:02.740 --> 0:28:07.860
There's a picture of him in his Karate uniform
and stuff and...

340
0:28:07.860 --> 0:28:08.860
Patrick:
Alright.

341
0:28:08.860 --> 0:28:09.860
Tara:
Oh there they are, there they go!

342
0:28:09.860 --> 0:28:11.040
There's a picture of him running, I don't
know, it went fast.

343
0:28:11.040 --> 0:28:12.040
Kathy:
What is up with the-?

344
0:28:12.040 --> 0:28:13.040
Patrick:
No it was set so each picture was supposed

345
0:28:13.040 --> 0:28:14.040
to show up with it.

346
0:28:14.040 --> 0:28:15.040
Tara:
Just do it again, do it again.

347
0:28:15.040 --> 0:28:16.040
Look quick again.

348
0:28:16.040 --> 0:28:17.260
Not all of them are of Patrick.

349
0:28:17.260 --> 0:28:22.220
That was a picture of Patrick in the green
shirt.

350
0:28:22.220 --> 0:28:23.529
Go again, one more time.

351
0:28:23.529 --> 0:28:24.529
There's Patrick!

352
0:28:24.529 --> 0:28:27.070
In the green shirt he's running.

353
0:28:27.070 --> 0:28:30.529
Anyway, keep going, keep going.

354
0:28:30.529 --> 0:28:31.919
Patrick:
Okay.

355
0:28:31.919 --> 0:28:38.980
The Karate picture that you saw was when I
received my yellow belt.

356
0:28:38.980 --> 0:28:45.270
I cannot find my black belt picture right
now so I just used the yellow belt.

357
0:28:45.270 --> 0:28:47.390
Umm, let me go back.

358
0:28:47.390 --> 0:28:54.370
The picture was too fast to show, but in Beep
Baseball there are only two bases.

359
0:28:54.370 --> 0:29:05.399
And the bases are ummm towers so when you
hit the bat with the T, the base will beep.

360
0:29:05.399 --> 0:29:11.980
And GoalBall there are only 3 players per
team: center, left and right.

361
0:29:11.980 --> 0:29:17.320
And in both sports, you have to use blindfolds
so I suppose a visual person would be able

362
0:29:17.320 --> 0:29:18.940
to play as well.

363
0:29:18.940 --> 0:29:19.940
Tara:
Okay.

364
0:29:19.940 --> 0:29:25.830
There's gonna be pictures again but I guess
they're gonna come back.

365
0:29:25.830 --> 0:29:27.610
There they go!

366
0:29:27.610 --> 0:29:28.789
Audience:
Bowling!

367
0:29:28.789 --> 0:29:34.720
Tara:
Oh, did you say what you got at bowling?

368
0:29:34.720 --> 0:29:35.909
Patrick:
Bowling?

369
0:29:35.909 --> 0:29:38.279
Tara:
Yeah, your score.

370
0:29:38.279 --> 0:29:39.470
Patrick:
Score?

371
0:29:39.470 --> 0:29:44.210
Tara:
What was your score, do you remember?

372
0:29:44.210 --> 0:29:46.450
Patrick:
No, I don't remember!

373
0:29:46.450 --> 0:29:47.450
I-

374
0:29:47.450 --> 0:29:48.450
Tara:
It was like a 140-something.

375
0:29:48.450 --> 0:29:50.420
I said, "Well Mom, he had the bumpers," and
she said "No, he didn’t!"

376
0:29:50.420 --> 0:29:54.910
You guys all played bowling the other day
and some of you didn't even break 100.

377
0:29:54.910 --> 0:29:56.090
Kathy:
Shame on us!

378
0:29:56.090 --> 0:29:57.779
[Laughter, Audience talking in the background
about their bowling scores.]

379
0:29:57.779 --> 0:29:58.779
Patrick:
Not gonna show it again.

380
0:29:58.779 --> 0:29:59.779
Tara:
This is his Brailler.

381
0:29:59.779 --> 0:30:04.260
Patrick:
It's going too fast for these too.

382
0:30:04.260 --> 0:30:09.350
Tara:
Try to look quickly for his Brailler writer.

383
0:30:09.350 --> 0:30:14.419
Looks like an old-fashioned type writer but
it's a Brailler.

384
0:30:14.419 --> 0:30:16.130
Okay, go ahead... the first picture!

385
0:30:16.130 --> 0:30:17.340
There it is.

386
0:30:17.340 --> 0:30:19.240
Okay do it again.

377
0:30:19.240 --> 0:30:20.240
Ready?

388
0:30:20.240 --> 0:30:21.240
Fist one.

389
0:30:21.240 --> 0:30:22.240
That's a Brailler.

390
0:30:22.240 --> 0:30:25.200
See that big hunk of metal?

391
0:30:25.200 --> 0:30:26.880
That has 6 keys.

392
0:30:26.880 --> 0:30:28.590
And that's what Brailles on 'em.

393
0:30:28.590 --> 0:30:32.270
Patrick:
The, the first picture you saw was a Perkins

394
0:30:32.270 --> 0:30:33.270
Brailler.

395
0:30:33.270 --> 0:30:38.640
You may have seen 9 keys but there are only
6 keys that produce Braille cells.

396
0:30:38.640 --> 0:30:42.800
The next picture is the Romeo Embosser, Juliet
and Tiger.

397
0:30:42.800 --> 0:30:45.730
Tara:
Did you say Romeo and Juliet?

398
0:30:45.730 --> 0:30:47.470
Patrick:
Or Romeo and Juliet!

399
0:30:47.470 --> 0:30:54.330
Well, my school had a Romeo and my friend's
school had a Juliet!

400
0:30:54.330 --> 0:30:56.350
But they're Braille printers.

401
0:30:56.350 --> 0:31:00.710
And you have a PacMate which I just demonstrated,
which also comes in the form of the, the type

402
0:31:00.710 --> 0:31:03.370
of keyboard that the Brailler showed.

403
0:31:03.370 --> 0:31:07.100
Tara:
That's what a Brailler looks like.

404
0:31:07.100 --> 0:31:10.380
That's how many keys a Brailler has.

405
0:31:10.380 --> 0:31:12.169
Patrick:
Which picture is that?

406
0:31:12.169 --> 0:31:14.179
Tara:
It's the Brailler.

407
0:31:14.179 --> 0:31:17.130
Patrick
That's the Brailler?

408
0:31:17.130 --> 0:31:21.559
Oh, it goes backwards I guess.

409
0:31:21.559 --> 0:31:25.240
Okay, now we have... okay.

410
0:31:25.240 --> 0:31:31.470
We have umm, CCTV's or ClosedCircuit Televisions.

411
0:31:31.470 --> 0:31:34.049
Not close captioned.

412
0:31:34.049 --> 0:31:41.559
That is an Optelec Clearview which is similar
to the one that I have at home.

413
0:31:41.559 --> 0:31:47.100
The one I have at school is called a Merlin
– Oh, and I mean Arthurian Legends.

414
0:31:47.100 --> 0:31:49.000
And this is called an Amigo.

415
0:31:49.000 --> 0:31:55.019
I use it over the paper and you can tilt it.

416
0:31:55.019 --> 0:31:59.340
There are many colors and they have different
shapes.

417
0:31:59.340 --> 0:32:04.380
Tara:
This, this you guys see -

418
0:32:04.380 --> 0:32:10.320
Patrick:
Hearing Aids, FM systems, Loop systems and

419
0:32:10.320 --> 0:32:11.320
speaker systems.

420
0:32:11.320 --> 0:32:19.519
FM systems is what I'm using now to control
my voice, but mostly is given to another speaker

421
0:32:19.519 --> 0:32:20.519
to hear.

422
0:32:20.519 --> 0:32:23.679
It will tranmit the voice directly to my hearing
aids.

423
0:32:23.679 --> 0:32:32.660
A loop system is a system if your hearing
aid has telecoil which is what hard of hearing

424
0:32:32.660 --> 0:32:35.650
people use to hear on the phone.

425
0:32:35.650 --> 0:32:41.049
And the room is wired with electromagnetic
cable, you'll be able to pick up the sound.

426
0:32:41.049 --> 0:32:47.029
There are also other systems that you can
use to loop around your neck.

427
0:32:47.029 --> 0:32:48.460
Tara:
He has hearing aids.

428
0:32:48.460 --> 0:32:49.460
And what Stephan has is a "cogular" implant.

429
0:32:49.460 --> 0:32:50.460
Kathy:
"Cochlear."

430
0:32:50.460 --> 0:32:51.460
Stephan corrected you by the way.

431
0:32:51.460 --> 0:32:52.460
Tara:
Cochlear!

432
0:32:52.460 --> 0:32:53.460
Sorry!

433
0:32:53.460 --> 0:32:54.460
Student 1:
Stephan it's a Cochlear implant?

434
0:32:54.460 --> 0:32:57.659
Kathy:
"Cochlear implant"

435
0:32:57.659 --> 0:33:05.769
Tara:
I can't get this up.

436
0:33:05.769 --> 0:33:08.470
Patrick:
Okay.

437
0:33:08.470 --> 0:33:15.220
[Patrick and Tara speaking softly]

438
0:33:15.220 --> 0:33:17.919
Tara:
Okay.

439
0:33:17.919 --> 0:33:23.460
Patrick:
I'm on the corner of the street.

440
0:33:23.460 --> 0:33:28.900
I have my street crossing card in display
like this, and my cane in display.

441
0:33:28.900 --> 0:33:49.539
Or it might be this way, as long as the cars
will be able to see it.

442
0:33:49.539 --> 0:33:50.710
Now...Oh, okay.

443
0:33:50.710 --> 0:33:53.330
Now I cross the street.

444
0:33:53.330 --> 0:33:54.330
Okay.

445
0:33:54.330 --> 0:33:55.330
Ummm.

446
0:33:55.330 --> 0:33:56.330
Tara:
So I come along and help him cross.

447
0:33:56.330 --> 0:33:57.330
Patrick:
Guiding is what I just demonstrated.

448
0:33:57.330 --> 0:33:58.330
But some people sign to me at the same time.

449
0:33:58.330 --> 0:34:14.520
I would use Guiding like this: walk and sign
at the same time instead of doing it this

450
0:34:14.520 --> 0:34:16.460
way.

451
0:34:16.460 --> 0:34:22.270
And guide dogs.

452
0:34:22.270 --> 0:34:35.220
There are only 2 organizations within the
United States that show – oh.

453
0:34:35.220 --> 0:34:36.710
Patrick:
This is a normal display.

454
0:34:36.710 --> 0:34:37.950
Tara:
Okay, try it again.

455
0:34:37.950 --> 0:34:38.950
Patrick:
Show them normal...

457
0:34:38.950 --> 0:34:41.419
Tara:
This is normal display, this is what you see

457
0:34:41.419 --> 0:34:42.419
every day, right?

458
0:34:42.419 --> 0:34:43.419
Okay go ahead.

459
0:34:43.419 --> 0:34:44.419
Patrick:
Okay.

460
0:34:44.419 --> 0:34:45.419
Kathy:
Mrs. Stork.

461
0:34:45.419 --> 0:34:46.419
Mrs. Stork!

462
0:34:46.419 --> 0:34:47.419
Mrs. Stork!

463
0:34:47.419 --> 0:34:48.419
He's going for dismissal.

464
0:34:48.419 --> 0:34:49.419
Tara:
This is what he has -

465
0:34:49.419 --> 0:34:50.419
Patrick:
Let me umm start a Word Document.

466
0:34:50.419 --> 0:34:51.419
Tara:
Do you see how big it has to be for him to

467
0:34:51.419 --> 0:34:52.419
see?

468
0:34:52.419 --> 0:34:53.419
That's the mouse!

469
0:34:53.419 --> 0:34:54.419
[Audience wows in the background]

470
0:34:54.419 --> 0:34:56.040
Patrick:
Let's start it.

471
0:34:56.040 --> 0:35:05.700
Tara:
Okay I'm going to type something.

472
0:35:05.700 --> 0:35:16.370
Do you want me to type something?

473
0:35:16.370 --> 0:35:23.810
Patrick:
Okay, type something.

474
0:35:23.810 --> 0:35:27.530
Tara:
Okay.

475
0:35:27.530 --> 0:35:34.460
See how the background went black?

476
0:35:34.460 --> 0:35:36.570
Okay, the background is -

477
0:35:36.570 --> 0:36:09.590
Patrick:
And it'll be about this big and I have to

478
0:36:09.590 --> 0:36:10.590
be this close.

479
0:36:10.590 --> 0:36:11.590
Tara:
He has to be about that close to read it still.

490
0:36:11.590 --> 0:36:12.590
Patrick:
"How are you?"

481
0:36:12.590 --> 0:36:13.590
Tara:
But at least he can read it, right?

482
0:36:13.590 --> 0:36:14.590
Patrick:
Okay.

483
0:36:14.590 --> 0:36:15.590
Now, guide dogs.

484
0:36:15.590 --> 0:36:16.590
Street crossing...

485
0:36:16.590 --> 0:36:17.590
Vibrotactile signals.

486
0:36:17.590 --> 0:36:18.590
In Charlotte there are Vibrotactile signals.

487
0:36:18.590 --> 0:36:19.590
If you were in Charlotte you may have noticed
limited poles that are beeping and also talking

488
0:36:19.590 --> 0:36:20.590
telling you that it's safe that tell you when
it's safe to cross.

489
0:36:20.590 --> 0:36:21.590
If you put your hand on that box it will vibrate
when it's safe to cross.

490
0:36:21.590 --> 0:36:22.590
Tara:
So in Charlotte they have these and you can

491
0:36:22.590 --> 0:36:23.590
touch it and feel that it's safe to cross,
okay?

492
0:36:23.590 --> 0:36:24.590
Patrick:
Support Serice Providers.

493
0:36:24.590 --> 0:36:28.110
In the United States they're called SSPs.

494
0:36:28.110 --> 0:36:35.540
But in Canada, England, and Australia they
are called Interveners.

495
0:36:35.540 --> 0:36:38.339
They act as guides, and volunteering interpreters.

496
0:36:38.339 --> 0:36:39.940
Kathy:
They're called what?

497
0:36:39.940 --> 0:36:42.359
Patrick:
There is congressional legislation right now

498
0:36:42.359 --> 0:36:43.500
going on to try to provide the money to train
SSPs.

499
0:36:43.500 --> 0:36:44.500
Patrick:
They're interveners...

500
0:36:44.500 --> 0:36:45.500
They're high beeps.

501
0:36:45.500 --> 0:36:46.500
Tara:
He only hears bass.

502
0:36:46.500 --> 0:36:47.500
So you really feel it.

503
0:36:47.500 --> 0:36:48.500
Patrick:
At this time, I have my sterio up on the third-floor

504
0:36:48.500 --> 0:36:56.300
blaring music and down on teh first floor
but everyone's complaining it's too loud.

505
0:36:56.300 --> 0:36:57.300
[laughter]

506
0:36:57.300 --> 0:36:58.300
Tara:
Okay.

507
0:36:58.300 --> 0:36:59.990
Any other questions?

508
0:36:59.990 --> 0:37:01.220
Will J!

509
0:37:01.220 --> 0:37:06.280
Will J:
With the street signs, when do you know it's

510
0:37:06.280 --> 0:37:07.280
safe?

513
0:37:07.280 --> 0:37:12.460
Tara:
...Street signs, when do you know it's safe?

514
0:37:12.460 --> 0:37:18.780
Patrick:
You mean Vibrotactile?

515
0:37:18.780 --> 0:37:25.375
Tara:
You mean if it doesn't have one of those beepers?

516
0:37:25.375 --> 0:37:44.940
Patrick:
While there's a street crossing on 95th Ave

517
0:37:44.940 --> 0:37:46.940
I mean Elizabeth avenue and Independence Avenue
in Charlotte there's Central Piedmont Community

518
0:37:46.940 --> 0:37:47.940
College.

519
0:37:47.940 --> 0:37:49.930
While I can tell it's safe to cross by the
traffic light and Vibrotactile, I can't tell

520
0:37:49.930 --> 0:37:56.990
if it's safe if the car is gonna turn or not
because I can't see across the street.

521
0:37:56.990 --> 0:38:00.130
I can only cross a two-lane street safety.

522
0:38:00.130 --> 0:38:06.510
Tara:
He can only cross one, you now, if it has

523
0:38:06.510 --> 0:38:48.530
one lane, but if there's two lanes he can't
cross and he only knows because he can feel

524
0:38:48.530 --> 0:38:49.530
the vibration.

525
0:38:49.530 --> 0:38:50.530
Desmond?

526
0:38:50.530 --> 0:38:51.530
Desmond:
How old are you?

527
0:38:51.530 --> 0:38:52.530
Patrick:
I just turned 20.

528
0:38:52.530 --> 0:38:53.530
Tara:
He just turned 20.

529
0:38:53.530 --> 0:38:54.530
[laughter]

530
0:38:54.530 --> 0:38:55.530
Shane:
Has he ever broken a board in karate?

531
0:38:55.530 --> 0:38:56.530
[Audience talking quietly]

532
0:38:56.530 --> 0:38:57.530
Tara:
No, he hasn’t.

533
0:38:57.530 --> 0:38:58.530
Patrick:
I haven't done sparing but I have done self-defense

534
0:38:58.530 --> 0:38:59.530
techniques.

535
0:38:59.530 --> 0:39:04.660
Tara:
Mallory!

535
0:39:04.660 --> 0:39:29.610
Mallory:
If you have the pass on the street, and what

536
0:39:29.610 --> 0:39:30.610
if no body helps you?

537
0:39:30.610 --> 0:39:31.610
What happens?

538
0:39:31.610 --> 0:39:32.610
Patrick:
Well that is a scenario I had a problem with.

539
0:39:32.610 --> 0:39:37.260
At a cross road, sometimes I have to wait,
wait, wait.

540
0:39:37.260 --> 0:39:40.300
Because the cars - sometimes the cars will
go right by, they won't stop.

541
0:39:40.300 --> 0:39:42.250
There's a law in North Carolina that you're
supposed to stop at least 15 feet away from

542
0:39:42.250 --> 0:39:47.530
the crossroads but I can't see that far.

543
0:39:47.530 --> 0:40:16.260
Well, I can see the cars there but I can't
tell if it stopped.

544
0:40:16.260 --> 0:40:18.510
So I'm just waiting.

545
0:40:18.510 --> 0:40:19.510
Tara:
So he has to wait a long time until someone

546
0:40:19.510 --> 0:40:20.510
comes.

547
0:40:20.510 --> 0:40:21.510
Yes?

548
0:40:21.510 --> 0:40:22.510
Student 1:
Okay so when, like I saw him typing on his

548
0:40:22.510 --> 0:40:23.510
computer, how does he know how to make the
sentences are together?

549
0:40:23.510 --> 0:40:24.510
Tara:
Like how does he see it?

550
0:40:24.510 --> 0:40:25.510
Ummm he knows like, he knows the keyboard
but how do you know what you're typing?
551
0:40:25.510 --> 0:40:26.510
Patrick:
Well I usually can type without even looking.

552
0:40:26.510 --> 0:40:27.510
The other day, wait, it was last Thursday.

553
0:40:27.510 --> 0:40:28.510
My English class was supposed to be doing
a presentation but my teacher set up a prompt

554
0:40:28.510 --> 0:40:29.010
for the beginning of class but I didn't set
up my laptop -
